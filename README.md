# redstone-node

RedStone Node is a core module in the RedStone ecosystem, which is responsible for fetching data from different sources and broadcasting it to the Arweave blockchain and the RedStone cache layer.

## üìñ Main concepts
| Concept | Description |
|---|---|
| Provider | An entity that fetches the data from external APIs, transforms it to a standard format, and persists collected information in the Redstone data ecosystem |
| Fetcher (source) | A module responsible for fetching the data from an external API. Examples: [coinbase fetcher](/src/fetchers/coinbase), [ecb fetcher](/src/fetchers/ecb/EcbFetcher.ts) |
| Manifest | Public JSON file that defines the provider's obligation regarding the data that they provide. It sets fetching interval, tokens, sources and other public technical details |
| Config | **Private** configuration file created by provider |
| Signer | A module responsible for data signing. Examples: EvmPriceSigner, ArweavePriceSigner |
| Aggregator | A module responsible for aggregating the data fetched from different sources. Median aggregator is used by default, it gets the median value.  |
| Broadcaster | A module responsible for broadcasting the signed data. Currently it send the data to the RedStone cache layer. |
